The room is made of wood, with exposed studs, beams, and a plywood subfloor. Large openings for windows offer a view of a dense forest outside. Strong sunlight streams in, casting long, diagonal shadows across the floor.\n\nIn the center of the room, a large stack of lumber is organized on supports. A person's hands are visible in the foreground, pulling a long piece of wood from this stack. In the background, another individual is actively working on the floor, kneeling and seemingly cutting or fastening a piece of lumber. The scene depicts active progress in the framing stage of building, with workers handling materials and constructing the wooden structure.",
