  "raw_response": "The video, shot from a first-person, overhead perspective looking down at the worker's feet and hands, shows a person engaged in construction work.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1.  **Initial Action (Frames 1-2):** The worker is standing over a long piece of dimensional lumber (likely a 2x4 or 2x6) lying on a plywood or OSB subfloor. They are using a hammer or pry bar. In the first frame, they appear to be prying something (possibly a nail or a temporary fastener) from the wood. In the second frame, they might be tapping something into place or adjusting the wood with the hammer.\n2.  **Moving Lumber (Frames 3-4):** The worker then begins to move the long piece of lumber. They drag it across the subfloor, repositioning it. Other pieces of lumber are visible on the floor, suggesting they are laying out or assembling components for framing, possibly a wall section, on the floor before it's tilted up.\n3.  **Setting:** The environment is an unfinished building, characterized by exposed wood framing (walls, ceiling joists/rafters) and the plywood/OSB subfloor.\n\nIn essence, the video shows a construction worker handling and positioning lumber, likely as part of the framing process for a building.",
