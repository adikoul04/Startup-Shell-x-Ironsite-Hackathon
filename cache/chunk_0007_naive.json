Pencil marks are visible on the lumber, indicating the pre-measured positions where the studs will be attached to the plate.\n4.  **Preparing to fasten:** The person is holding a hammer or pry bar in their right hand, poised to begin fastening the pieces together, likely with nails.\n\nThe overall activity is the **assembly of a wall section** on the floor, which will then be lifted into place as part of the building's frame. In the background, other framed walls are already visible, indicating an ongoing construction project.",
