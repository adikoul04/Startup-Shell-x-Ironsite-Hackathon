Other framed walls are visible around them.\n2.  **Layout:** They lay the long piece of lumber down on the subfloor. Several shorter pieces of lumber (likely studs or cripples) are also visible nearby.\n3.  **Assembly:** The person then arranges the shorter pieces of lumber, positioning them against or under the longer piece.\n4.  **Fastening:** Using a tool that appears to be a framing nailer or hammer, they begin to attach the shorter pieces to the longer piece, effectively assembling a section of a wall or a similar structural component.\n\nThe video captures the process of laying out and fastening lumber to build part of a wooden frame for a building.",
