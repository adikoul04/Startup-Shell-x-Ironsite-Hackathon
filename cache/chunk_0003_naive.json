  "raw_response": "The video shows the interior of a house that is currently under construction, specifically during the framing phase.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n*   **Setting:** The house has its wooden framework (studs, joists, rafters) largely in place, but no drywall, insulation, or finishes are visible. The subfloor is laid.\n*   **Materials:** Piles of lumber are stacked on the floor, ready to be used.\n*   **Activity:** A construction worker, wearing a hat and dark shirt, is visible in the background. He is actively cutting pieces of wood using a circular saw on a sawhorse.\n*   **Perspective:** The video is shot with a wide-angle lens, likely from a camera mounted on someone moving through the space, providing a dynamic view of the construction site.\n*   **Lighting:** Natural light streams in through the open window and door frames, casting shadows across the wooden floor.\n\nIn essence, it's a glimpse into the active framing process of a new house.",
