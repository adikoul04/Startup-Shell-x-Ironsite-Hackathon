The walls are framed with wooden studs, and the floor is made of OSB (Oriented Strand Board).\n*   **Action:** The person is actively handling and organizing various lengths of lumber (wooden planks/beams) on the OSB floor. They pick up pieces, move them, and lay them out, seemingly sorting them or preparing them for assembly or cutting.\n*   **Purpose:** The actions suggest the person is engaged in the framing process of the building, preparing materials for walls, floors, or other structural components.",
