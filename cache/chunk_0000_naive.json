  "raw_response": "The video shows a first-person perspective, looking down at a person's feet and lower body, on what appears to be a construction site. The floor is made of OSB (Oriented Strand Board), and exposed wooden framing is visible on the left side, indicating an unfinished building.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sequence:\n1.  **Initial State:** A tool belt or pouch, dark with some yellow accents, is lying on the OSB floor in front of the person's feet. The person is wearing jeans and black sneakers with white soles.\n2.  **Putting on the Tool Belt:** The person then bends down (implied by the movement of the tool belt closer to their body) and puts on the tool belt.\n3.  **Securing the Belt:** Their hands become visible as they adjust and secure the tool belt around their waist.\n4.  **Ready to Work:** By the end of the video, the tool belt is fully worn around the person's waist, and they are standing upright, seemingly ready to begin their work on the construction site.",
